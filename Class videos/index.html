                <h1><b>NEET Biology Syllabus</b></h1>
                <p>The NEET biology syllabus 2025 comprises two branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany focuses on studying
                    plant life, while Zoology deals with animal biology. The NEET 2025 biology syllabus is designed to
                    assess candidates on the topics covered in Class 11 and Class 12 of their school curriculum. It is
                    important to be aware of the scope of the concepts that need to be studied to prepare for the
                    biology section of the exam effectively. The biology syllabus for NEET 2025 is extensive, covering a
                    wide range of topics. Therefore, one needs to understand and go through the biology NEET syllabus
                    2025 thoroughly.</p>
